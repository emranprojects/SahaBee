## Getting started

Here are various ways of contributing to SahaBee.

### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you spot a problem with SahaBee, [search if an issue already exists](https://github.com/emranbm/SahaBee/issues). 

#### Solve an issue

Scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/emranbm/SahaBee/issues) to find one that interests you. There may be some issues labeled as [good first issue](https://github.com/emranbm/SahaBee/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22); these issues are best fits for contributing for the first time, as they're general, simplified, and clear enough to get the hands on.  
As a general rule, we donâ€™t assign issues to anyone. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

### Make Changes

#### Make changes locally

1. [Install Git LFS](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-large-files/versioning-large-files/installing-git-large-file-storage).

2. Fork the repository.
    - Using GitHub Desktop:
      - [Getting started with GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/getting-started-with-github-desktop) will guide you through setting up Desktop.
      - Once Desktop is set up, you can use it to [fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/cloning-and-forking-repositories-from-github-desktop)!
    - Using the command line:
      - [Fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo#fork-an-example-repository) so that you can make your changes without affecting the original project until you're ready to merge them.

3. Install **Docker** and **Docker Compose**. For more information, see [Docker Engine overview](https://docs.docker.com/engine/).

4. Create a working branch and start with your changes!

### Commit your update

Commit the changes once you are happy with them. See [Git Commit Style Guide](https://gist.github.com/ericavonb/3c79e5035567c8ef3267) to know how commit messages should look like.

### Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).
- If you run into any merge issues, checkout this [git tutorial](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/managing-merge-conflicts) to help you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.

### Your PR is merged!

Congratulations :tada::tada: SahaBee thanks you :sparkles:. 

Once your PR is merged, your contributions will be publicly visible on the [repo](https://github.com/emranbm/SahaBee/graphs/contributors). 

Now that you are part of the SahaBee community.
