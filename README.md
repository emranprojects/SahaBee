A simple api for rollcalling during the remote-work.
## What problem does SahaBee solve?
We are currently remote working because of the corona virus. These days it's a regular task for us to report our work-times to the company as a standard excel sheet.  
I found it boring to fill a timesheet excel every time; so decided to develop a small (yet not powerfull!) API to just call it and get the reports automatically.
